        <strong> Ingredients:</strong> 200 grams paneer (Indian cottage cheese),
        cut into cubes 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste 1 tablespoon lemon juice
        1 tablespoon gram flour (besan) 1 teaspoon red chili powder 1 teaspoon
        turmeric powder 1 teaspoon garam masala 1 teaspoon chaat masala 1
        teaspoon cumin powder 1 teaspoon coriander powder Salt to taste 2
        tablespoons oil Skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes For the
        marinade: 1/4 cup thick yogurt 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste 1
        tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon red chili powder 1 teaspoon turmeric
        powder 1 teaspoon garam masala 1 teaspoon chaat masala 1 teaspoon cumin
        powder 1 teaspoon coriander powder Salt to taste 1 tablespoon oil <br />
        <strong>Instructions:</strong> In a bowl, combine all the marinade
        ingredients and mix well. Add the paneer cubes to the marinade and
        gently coat them with the mixture. Let it marinate for at least 30
        minutes or refrigerate for a couple of hours for better flavor
        absorption. In a separate bowl, make a paste by combining ginger-garlic
        paste, lemon juice, gram flour, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam
        masala, chaat masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, salt, and oil. Mix
        well to form a smooth paste. Take the marinated paneer cubes and coat
        them with the prepared spice paste, ensuring each piece is well coated.
        Allow the paneer to rest for another 10-15 minutes. Preheat your grill
        or oven to medium-high heat. Skewer the paneer cubes onto the soaked
        skewers, leaving a little gap between each piece. Grill the paneer
        skewers for about 10-12 minutes, turning them occasionally, until they
        are golden brown and slightly charred on all sides. Alternatively, you
        can also bake them in a preheated oven at 200°C (400°F) for about 15-20
        minutes until cooked through. Once cooked, remove the paneer sholay
        kababs from the grill/oven and let them cool slightly. Serve the paneer
        sholay kababs hot with mint chutney, onion rings, and lemon wedges.
        Enjoy the delicious and spicy Paneer Sholay Kababs as a appetizer or as
        a part of your meal!
