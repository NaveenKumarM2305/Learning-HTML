        <strong> Ingredients:</strong> 8-10 chicken wings 2 tablespoons soy
        sauce 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste 1 tablespoon red chili sauce 1
        tablespoon tomato ketchup 1 teaspoon vinegar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire
        sauce 1 teaspoon garam masala 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder 1/2
        teaspoon salt (or to taste) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2
        tablespoons cornstarch Oil for deep frying Spring onion greens
        (optional, for garnish) <br />
        <strong>Instructions:</strong> Start by preparing the chicken wings.
        Remove the skin from the wings, if desired. Cut the chicken wings at the
        joint to separate the drumettes and flats. Keep the wingtips intact as
        they will form the handle of the lollipops. In a bowl, combine soy
        sauce, ginger-garlic paste, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, vinegar,
        Worcestershire sauce, garam masala, black pepper powder, and salt. Mix
        well to form a marinade. Add the chicken wings to the marinade and coat
        them thoroughly. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes. For better
        flavor absorption, you can refrigerate them for a couple of hours or
        overnight. In a separate bowl, combine all-purpose flour and cornstarch.
        Mix well to make a coating mixture. Heat oil in a deep pan or skillet
        for deep frying. The oil should be hot but not smoking. Take each
        marinated chicken wing and roll the meat down towards the end to form a
        lollipop shape. Press the meat down to the bottom to create a tight
        lollipop shape. Dip each lollipop into the coating mixture, ensuring it
        is evenly coated. Shake off any excess coating. Carefully place the
        coated chicken lollipops into the hot oil. Fry them in batches for about
        8-10 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Make sure the
        chicken is cooked through. Once cooked, remove the chicken lollipops
        from the oil and drain them on a paper towel to remove any excess oil.
        Garnish with chopped spring onion greens, if desired. Serve the chicken
        lollipops hot as an appetizer with your favorite dipping sauce or as a
        side dish. Enjoy the delicious and crispy chicken lollipops!
