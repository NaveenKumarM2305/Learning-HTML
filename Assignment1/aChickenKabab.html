        <strong> Ingredients:</strong> 1 pound (450 grams) boneless chicken, cut
        into bite-sized pieces 1/2 cup plain yogurt 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2
        tablespoons oil 2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste 1 teaspoon cumin powder
        1 teaspoon coriander powder 1 teaspoon paprika or red chili powder
        (adjust according to your spice preference) 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
        1/2 teaspoon garam masala 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder Salt to taste
        Skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes For garnish (optional): Chopped
        coriander leaves Lemon wedges Onion rings
        <br />
        <strong>Instructions:</strong> In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon
        juice, oil, ginger-garlic paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, paprika
        or red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, black pepper powder,
        and salt. Mix well to make a marinade. Add the chicken pieces to the
        marinade and coat them evenly. Cover the bowl and let the chicken
        marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. For best results,
        marinate overnight. Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat.
        Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers, leaving a little gap
        between each piece. Place the skewers on the preheated grill or arrange
        them on a baking sheet if using the oven. Grill or bake the chicken
        kebabs for about 12-15 minutes, turning them occasionally, until they
        are cooked through and nicely browned on all sides. Make sure the
        chicken is cooked thoroughly and reaches an internal temperature of
        165°F (74°C). Once cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill or oven and
        let them rest for a few minutes. Optional: Garnish the chicken kebabs
        with chopped coriander leaves and serve with lemon wedges and onion
        rings on the side. Serve the chicken kebabs hot as an appetizer or as a
        main course with naan bread, rice, or a salad. Enjoy your homemade
        chicken kebabs!
