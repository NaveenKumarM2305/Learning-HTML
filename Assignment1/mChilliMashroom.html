        <strong> Ingredients:</strong> 1 pound (450g) mushrooms (button
        mushrooms or any variety of your choice) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1
        onion, thinly sliced 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced 1-2 green chilies,
        finely chopped (adjust according to your spice preference) 1 capsicum
        (bell pepper), thinly sliced 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon tomato
        ketchup 1 tablespoon chili sauce (adjust according to your spice
        preference) 1 teaspoon vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar Salt to taste Freshly
        ground black pepper Spring onions, chopped (for garnish) <br />
        <strong>Instructions:</strong> Clean the mushrooms by wiping them with a
        damp cloth or paper towel. Trim the stems if needed and slice the
        mushrooms into thick pieces. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet
        or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they
        turn translucent and slightly golden. Add the minced garlic and chopped
        green chilies to the skillet. Sauté for a minute until the garlic
        becomes fragrant. Add the sliced mushrooms and capsicum (bell pepper) to
        the skillet. Stir-fry for about 4-5 minutes until the mushrooms start to
        release their moisture and become slightly tender. In a small bowl, mix
        together soy sauce, tomato ketchup, chili sauce, vinegar, sugar, salt,
        and black pepper. Adjust the seasoning according to your taste. Pour the
        sauce mixture over the mushrooms in the skillet. Stir well to coat the
        mushrooms evenly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mushrooms
        cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.
        Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Garnish with chopped spring
        onions. Remove from heat and serve hot as a side dish or as a main
        course with steamed rice or noodles. Enjoy your homemade chili
        mushrooms!
